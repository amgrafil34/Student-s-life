      <h2>Who Are you, and do you see yourself as a STUDENT?</h2>
      <p>
        Student is often defined by the knowledge and skills. But, student is a person who is intelligent enough to think that
        striving and acting in a good behavior is much better.

      <h2>Challenges They Face</h2>
      <p>
        Despite of their skills and knowledge, students do face challenges. Some struggle with understanding lessons, managing their time, or feeling excited about school. Tests can be scary, and not everyone has the same access to help. On top of that, some kids face bullying, feel lonely, or have worries about their family or their own feelings. Money problems, getting to school, or having a safe place to live can also get in the way. To help kids succeed, we need to look at all these problems and find ways to support them at school, at home, and in the community.

      <h>what should students do?</h></h2>
      <p>
        If school feels hard, there are things you can do! First, ask for help when you need it – talk to your teachers or find a tutor. Make a plan for studying and stick to it. Use the resources your school offers, like the library or study groups. If you’re feeling down or stressed, talk to a friend, family member, or school counselor. Take care of yourself by eating healthy, exercising, and getting enough sleep. If you're having money problems or trouble getting to school, ask for help from your school or community. Remember, it’s okay to ask for help, and there are people who care and want to support you!
